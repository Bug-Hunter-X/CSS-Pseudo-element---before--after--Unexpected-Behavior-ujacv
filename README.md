# CSS Pseudo-element Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes tricky issue with CSS pseudo-elements (`::before` and `::after`). The problem lies in the unexpected behavior or complete absence of the pseudo-element despite seemingly correct CSS.

## Bug Description
The primary issue is that the pseudo-element, while correctly styled, doesn't render as expected.  This can stem from several less obvious causes:

* **Specificity Issues:** Other CSS rules with higher specificity might override the pseudo-element's styles or even prevent its generation.
* **Insufficient Content:** The parent element might not have enough content for the pseudo-element to attach to (the `content` property must be non-empty for rendering).
* **JavaScript Interference:** Dynamically changing the parent element's content or style through JavaScript can interfere with the pseudo-element's behavior.
* **Display Property:** Setting `display: none;` on the parent will prevent rendering of pseudo elements.
* **Floating/Positioning:** Complex layouts with floating or absolutely positioned elements can sometimes cause unexpected interactions with pseudo-elements.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining CSS specificity, ensuring the parent element has content, and investigating any potential JavaScript interference. Debugging tools can help in pinpointing the problem. Sometimes a more explicit selector is needed or rethinking how content and styles are applied.
