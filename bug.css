The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of a pseudo-element (:before or :after) is not working as intended. This could stem from several uncommon reasons, like incorrect selector specificity, the element not having sufficient content for the pseudo-element to attach to, or interactions with other CSS properties or JavaScript manipulation.

```css
.container:before {
  content: "This text should appear!";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}

.container { 
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

The pseudo-element might not appear or appear unexpectedly, possibly due to specificity issues in other CSS rules, conflicting JavaScript code affecting element content, or unexpected display property values like `display: none`.
