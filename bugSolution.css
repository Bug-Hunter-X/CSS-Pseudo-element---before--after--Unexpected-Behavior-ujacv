Several solutions exist depending on the root cause:

1. **Specificity Check:** Examine the CSS for conflicting rules. Make sure the selector for your pseudo-element is specific enough to override any other rules.

2. **Content Verification:** Confirm the parent element has content for the pseudo-element to attach to. For example, you can add a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`) or a very small transparent image if the parent element is initially empty.

3. **JavaScript Inspection:** Review your JavaScript code to identify potential conflicts or unintended manipulation of the parent element's content or styles.

4. **Check display Property**: Ensure that the display property is not set to `none` which will prevent any pseudo-elements rendering.

5. **Debugging Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and its styles. This will aid in identifying conflicting CSS rules or JavaScript manipulations.

```css
/*Possible Solution: Adding a non-breaking space to the container*/
.container {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  /*Add a non-breaking space here*/
  content: "\A0";
}

.container:before {
  content: "This text should appear!";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```
